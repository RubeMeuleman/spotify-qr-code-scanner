# Spotify QR code scanner
Create and scan QR codes using python

### What is this repository about?
This repository is a visualisation of a small Case Study I made up myself. The concept is aimed to generate and scan QR codes based on Spotify songs. With only 2 simple scripts are you able to do these actions.

### How can I use this project in my daily life?
Using this project, is it possible to integrate the goals I set up in your own lifestyle. Generate a few QR codes, print them and use it to quickly play a song. Or choose to develop a larger project with these files, like integrating it into an Orange PI or directly sharing the QR codes when generated!

### How do I use this project?
- Clone the repository to your local device using:
```
git clone https://github.com/RubeMeuleman/spotify-qr-code-scanner.git
```
- Navigate to the `spotify-qr-code-scanner` directory
- Open a terminal and make sure you're in the `spotify-qr-code-scanner` directory
- Install all packages used, which are listed in `requirements.txt` using (windows):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run `create_code.py` to generate a new QR code or `scan_code.py` to scan an existing one.
